## Challenge
> Save time in referrals in seeing multiple doctors. This is a way to have health records in a secure centralized location.

## Solution
> Doctors have to register to make an account and verify the practice. Doctors can then create unique patient accounts. These patient accounts hold their entire health history in one location. And based on doctor's clearance, they can view all of the records associated with their field. Doctor can also read and add visit information.

## What we struggled with
> accessing a database in the timeframe we have. PHP doesn't want to work with us. ... We tried.

## Accomplishments
> We submitted on time. Website was nominated with my team (Michelle Yu, Nicole Boodhai and Sahara Fathelbab) for the healthcare industry in a hackathon recently with over 240 attendees.

## What we learned
> Planning and creating prototypes helps.

## What's next
> Get database and PHP to work. As we get private services, we would like to introduce SS # as a way for doctor offices to pull up basic patient information to register them instead of filling out forms.
